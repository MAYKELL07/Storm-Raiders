# Raiders on Deck - Final Rulebook and System Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to **Raiders on Deck**, a pirate-themed tabletop game of high-seas adventure and strategy. Players become rival captains in the world of Aetheria, commanding ships and crews to battle for treasure, glory and control of the oceans. The core design balances accessibility and depth: simple to learn, yet rich in tactical choices.

## Game Components

- **Ship Cards (A5)** - Each player starts with a unique ship card. Ship stats include Hit Points (HP), Attack Bonus, Defense, Crew Capacity and a special Captain Buff.
- **Crew Tokens** - Represent crew members. Each token allows one reroll per attack. The number of active crew tokens cannot exceed a ship's Crew Capacity; extra crew become inactive (see Crew Mechanics).
- **Dice** - Two six-sided dice per player for attack rolls and priority determination.
- **Decks of Cards** - Cards come in several categories: Action/Item/Equipment, Loot/Resource, Event and Starter Deck.
- **Tokens** - Markers for ammunition, gold and damage modifiers.

## Setup

- **Select Ships:** Shuffle the ship cards and deal one randomly to each player. The ship card displays HP, Attack Bonus, Defense, Crew Capacity and a Captain Buff.
- **Crew and Tokens:** Give each player crew tokens up to their ship's capacity (typically 2-4). Keep spare tokens nearby.
- **Starter Hands:** Shuffle the 15-card Starter Deck. Each player draws three cards. Starter cards provide minor bonuses or setbacks, ensuring varied openings without unbalancing play.
- **Prepare Decks:** Shuffle the Action/Item/Equipment deck, the Loot/Resource deck and the Event deck separately. Place them face-down within reach of all players.
- **Determine First Player:** Each player rolls two dice; the highest total goes first.

## Ship Cards & Captain Buffs

Ship cards define each vessel's strengths and weaknesses. Attack Bonus adds to attack rolls; Defense reduces incoming damage; Crew Capacity limits rerolls. Captain Buffs grant unique abilities.

| Ship Name | HP  | Attack Bonus | Defense | Crew Capacity | Captain Buff | Brief Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Black Serpent** | 100 | +2  | 0 % | 3   | **Savvy Captain** - Once per attack, reroll one die without spending a crew token. | Balanced attacker with reliable rerolls. |
| **Stormrider** | 110 | +0  | 5 % | 4   | **Wave Master** - When you choose Maneuver, reduce incoming damage by 40 % instead of 20 %. | Durable defender, less offensive punch. |
| **Golden Harpoon** | 90  | +3  | 0 % | 2   | **Treasure Fiend** - When you Plunder, draw two Loot cards and keep one. | Fast, fragile, loot-focused. |
| **Crimson Kraken** | 100 | +1  | 10 % | 3   | **Vengeful Wrath** - Whenever you take damage, the attacker suffers 3 damage. | Moderate stats with reactive damage. |
| **Azure Wave** | 95  | +2  | 5 % | 4   | **Master Surgeon** - When you Repair, heal 8 HP instead of 5 HP. | Mixed offense/defense with enhanced healing. |
| **Silent Corsair** | 85  | +3  | 0 % | 3   | **Shadow Veil** - Once per game, ignore the effect of an Event card. | High risk, high reward with a one-time escape. |

Ships are designed so that strengths in one area come with trade-offs in another, ensuring balance and variety.

## Crew Mechanics

- **Active vs. Inactive Crew:** Each ship's Crew Capacity indicates the maximum number of active crew tokens a player can use. Active crew provide rerolls and card synergies. If a player gains more crew than their capacity (e.g. via cards), excess crew become _inactive_. Inactive crew tokens do not grant rerolls or bonuses but remain in the player's possession and can become active if crew are lost later (due to sabotage, mutiny or other effects).
- **Rerolls:** Each active crew token allows a reroll of one die during an attack. Multiple rerolls can be used if you have enough active crew.
- **Crew Synergy:** Some cards and captain buffs refer to crew. For example, Extra Crew increases your crew count; cards like Gunner Mate might provide bonuses if you have two or more crew.
- **Crew Loss:** Certain Event or Item cards may force players to lose crew tokens, reducing reroll options and activating previously inactive crew if available.

This system keeps random crew gains meaningful without unbalancing early turns.

## Turn Sequence & Actions

- **Priority Roll:** At the start of each round all players roll two dice. Highest total acts first; reroll ties.
- **Choose Action:** On your turn, select one action:
- **Fire Cannons** - Roll two dice, add your ship's Attack Bonus and crew rerolls (if used), then apply damage minus target's Defense.
- **Repair** - Restore 5 HP (up to your ship's maximum). Some ships or items may modify this amount.
- **Plunder** - Draw one card from the Loot deck (see Loot/Resource Cards). Golden Harpoon's captain buff allows drawing two and keeping one.
- **Reload** - Gain two ammunition tokens (needed for some special attacks).
- **Maneuver** - Reduce damage from the next attack by 20 % (stacking with your ship's Defense). Stormrider increases this reduction.
- **Crew Rerolls:** Spend crew tokens to reroll attack dice as desired; each token permits one reroll per attack.
- **End of Round:** After all players act, resolve Event cards or ongoing effects (e.g. Burn damage), then begin a new round.

Damage is calculated as _(sum of the dice + Attack Bonus) × (1 - Defense)_. Round down fractional damage.

## Action Consequences & Limits

Every action in _Raiders on Deck_ is designed to carry a trade‑off. These limits prevent repetitive play and encourage varied strategy:

- **Fire Cannons** - Attacking spends **one ammunition token**. If you have no ammo, you cannot fire until you reload or gain ammo from a card. Cards such as Powder Keg add additional recoil damage.
- **Repair** - You may only choose Repair if your ship has taken damage since your last turn. When you Repair, your crew is busy: your active **Crew Capacity is reduced by 1** until your next turn. You cannot choose Repair on consecutive turns unless you have taken new damage in between.
- **Plunder** - Plundering draws a card from the Loot deck, but you **forgo attacking or maneuvering** this turn. While plundering, you cannot benefit from Maneuver or other defensive actions if attacked before your next turn.
- **Reload** - Reloading grants two ammunition tokens but prevents you from attacking or plundering that turn. Reloading also exhausts your crew: you cannot choose Maneuver on your next turn.
- **Maneuver** - Maneuvering reduces incoming damage by 20 %, but your next attack is less effective: you do **not add your Attack Bonus** to your next damage roll (you still roll dice). This represents losing offensive momentum while dodging.

These consequences ensure players must weigh each action carefully rather than repeating a single choice without risk.

## Card Categories

### Starter Deck

The Starter Deck contains 15 cards drawn at random by players at the beginning. Ten provide small boosts (ammo crates, minor hull patches, crew mates, weak cannonballs, spyglass peeks, basic armor plating, grappling hook, wind gust, rum flask, 2 gold), while five impose minor setbacks (leaky barrel for minor damage, jammed cannon reducing first attack's damage, lazy crew preventing rerolls for one turn, wet gunpowder lowering first attack damage, rotten food causing a discard). These cards keep early turns unpredictable yet fair.

## Winning the Game

Victory can be achieved in different ways:

- **Last Ship Standing:** The game ends when all but one ship are sunk.
- **Treasure Victory:** A player reaches a set amount of gold (e.g. 20) and claims victory.
- **Map Victory:** A player collects three Treasure Map Fragments and wins instantly.

Groups can choose their preferred win condition at the start.

## Scalability & Expansions

- **Scalability:** The absence of a physical board and simultaneous actions allow for smooth play from four up to twelve or more players. Priority rolls and single-action turns keep downtime minimal.
- **Expansions:** Future expansions can introduce new ships with distinct Captain Buffs, additional card sets with weather phenomena, sea monsters, or magical artifacts, and narrative campaigns linking games into a larger story. An optional digital companion app could track stats and play sound effects.

## Conclusion

This final version of **Raiders on Deck** fuses simplicity with strategic depth. Balanced ship stats and unique Captain Buffs create varied playstyles, while the crew system keeps luck in check and encourages resource management. Clear rules and modular components make the game accessible to new players and expandable for experienced groups. All cards and mechanics have been refined to ensure fair play and replayability.
